# IOT-Gas-leakage-detector-mini project for your assignment -
A Gas Leakage Detector is an IoT-based safety device that detects the presence of harmful gases (such as LPG, methane, or CO) and alerts users to prevent accidents. This system is essential in homes, industries, and laboratories to ensure safety.
Advantages
✔ Early detection prevents accidents.
✔ Can be integrated with IoT for remote monitoring.
✔ Suitable for homes, industries, and gas storage areas.

Future Enhancements
🔹 Add automatic gas shutoff valves for more safety.
🔹 Use AI/ML to predict gas leaks based on patterns.
🔹 Integrate with smart home systems for automation.

This project is simple yet highly effective in ensuring safety from hazardous gas leaks.
